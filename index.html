      <p>Dear Ms.Devi Manoj,</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your interest in pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University collage. I have carefully reviewed your application materials and was impressed by your academic achievements and research experience in machine learning and data science.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this time, I would like to invite you to attend a virtual interview to further discuss your research interests and explore how they align with the ongoing work in our lab. We believe your background could contribute significantly to our current projects in natural language processing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please let me know your availability for a 30-minute meeting within the next two weeks. I look forward to our conversation.
      </p>

      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p>
